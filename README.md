The final user to see this should be any HHRR's person who wants to employ new people for its company. 

I have decided to use a very minimal color palette for my CV: a background grey and a black for the text.
This concept of CV is not for anyone looking for any small details with impactful design. 
As the employer probably has to look over hundreds of curriculums, the point of it being so simple is clear: 
to give the information about myself fast so it can decide easily if my expertise and knowledge is valueable for the company.
